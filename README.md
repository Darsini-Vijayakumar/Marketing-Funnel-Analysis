---------------------------------------------

**1. Project Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the effectiveness of different marketing channels across various stages of the marketing funnel - awareness, consideration and conversion. By utilizing data from marketing channels and sub-channels, I aim to identify the most efficient channels that drive conversions and optimize marketing spend.

**2. Data Cleaning**

The dataset Data_for_analysis.csv contains records of marketing activities spanning over two years, covering various aspects such aschannels and sub-channels, leads generated, sales closed, customer conversion, and customer spend. This comprehensive dataset allows for a detailed analysis of marketing performance across different channels and customer segments.

**3. Key Questions Answered Through Analysis**

 1. Which marketing channels perform best at different stages of the marketing funnel?
 2. How do conversion rates vary across different marketing channels?
 3. What are the trends in marketing conversion across various quarters and channels?
 4. Which marketing channels offer the best return on investment (ROI)?

 for better conversion rates.
